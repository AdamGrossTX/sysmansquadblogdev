## Our core values

### We Foster Education

If people aren't learning from our efforts here, we are wasting our time. We want to enable people to learn by doing and by sharing what they know.

### We Pursue Excellence

We want to ensure that the community gets our best work. By having a team of mentors who can review content and coach contributors, we will produce top quality content for the community.

### We Practice Mentorship
_[Be The Master](https://bethemaster.com/the-book/)_ is an amazing book by [Don Jones](https://twitter.com/concentrateddon) that explores the idea that if you aren't willing to train/mentor others to eventually take your job someday, then maybe you are in the wrong job. The creation of this site was largely inspired by the premise of _Be The Master_.
### We Create Fun

Being a Squad member should be fun and exciting. This isn't a job and no one is getting paid. We simply want to share what we know with the community in whatever way works best for us.

## Some Backstory

I decided to start SysManSquad after Midwest Management Summit - Desert Edition (MMSDE) in late 2018 after attending their well-attended "Tips & Tricks" session. After attending sessions all week and listening to experts speak, the attendees get a chance to get up and share their best tips and tricks. There are generally 25-50 participants who share their best stuff (in 3 minutes!). I have attended 3 MMS conferences and each time, the Tips & Tricks session always impresses me.

There are a ton of people in this community with great ideas who just need a place to share them. SysManSquad was built to be a kind of extension of the Tips & Tricks session - a place where anyone can share their idea - even if it's just 1, we want to share it with the rest of the community.

I don't know how well this will work out, but we won't know until we try. So, if you have something to share, or you want to try mentoring other people, or you want someone to turn your idea into a blog or video or even a talk, come join the Squad!
